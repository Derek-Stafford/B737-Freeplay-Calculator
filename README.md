# B737-7-8-9-Horizontal-Stab-Check
A python-based code that I wrote to calculate the freeplay values of Boeing 737NG aircraft. This was really more of a practice to become more familiar with calculation based coding. All variables and formulas, except for the x and y variables, are dervied from the appropriate AMM/Routine Maintenance Task Card.
