# B737-Horizontal-Stab-Check
A python-based code that I wrote to help calculate the freeplay values of Boeing 737NG, 700-900 and 737-Max aircraft to calculate or to verify work performed. The x and y variables for the 737NG aircraft aren't necessary for the overall calculations but are there to see what those respective values are seperated from the rest of the equation. The if/else statements make it easier to see what portions of the check pass or fail based the given limits for each value without flipping back and forth to check the original values. All variables and formulas, except for the x and y variables, are dervied from the appropriate AMM/Routine Maintenance Task Card.
