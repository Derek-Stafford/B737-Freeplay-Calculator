# B737-7-8-9-Horizontal-Stab-Check
A python-based code that I wrote to help calculate the freeplay values of Boeing 737NG, 700-900 series aircraft or to verify work performed. The three seperate user_input's for D1-D3 are to account for the variability of the indicator readings between the Left (D1) and Right (D2) sides plus the center section (D3). The x and y variables aren't necessary for the overall calculations but are there to see what those respective values are seperated from the rest of the equation. The if/else statements make it easier to see what portions of the check pass or fail status based the given limits for each value without flipping back and forth to check the original values. All variables and formulas, except for the x and y variables, are dervied from the appropriate AMM/Routine Maintenance Task Card.
