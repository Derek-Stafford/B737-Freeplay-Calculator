# B737-7-8-9-Horizontal-Stab-Check
A python-based code that I wrote to calculate the freeplay values of Boeing 737NG, 700-900 series aircraft or to verify work performed. The three seperate user_input's for D1-D3 are to account for the variability of the indicator readings between the Left (D1) and Right (D2) sides plus the center section (D3). The x and y variables aren't necessary for the overapl calculations but are there to see what those respective values are seperated from the rest of the equation. All variables and formulas, except for the x and y variables, are dervied from the appropriate AMM/Routine Maintenance Task Card.
