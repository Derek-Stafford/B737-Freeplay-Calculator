# B737-7-8-9-Horizontal-Stab-Check
A simple code for work to hopefully to make calculating the overall freeplay check of a Boeing 737, 700-900 series aircraft easier. This is still a work in progress. Future intentions: 1) Expand on the code by making it into a functioning app for iphone users and/or basic-ish webiste for non-iphone users, 2) Copy and adjust the code for Boeing 737-Max Variants.
* Note 1: The formula, limits, and variables are the ones stated in the AMM/Task Card and can't be replaced by anything else.
